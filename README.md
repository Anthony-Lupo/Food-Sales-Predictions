# Food-Sales-Predictions
Sales Predictions for food items at sold at various stores.


This is my first ever Computer Science Project, Worked through on the first half of my time in a BootCamp at Coding Dojo.

The data set is information on various Grocery Stores/Supermarkets and their sales.

My analysis includes cleaning of the data, creating analysis and explanatory visuals, creating a supervised ML Regression Analysis of the data and presenting my findings.
